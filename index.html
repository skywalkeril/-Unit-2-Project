  <h4 class="heavy">Heavy Tank<h4>

      <p> Heavy tanks achieved their greatest, albeit limited, success when fighting lighter tanks and destroying
        fortifications. Heavy tanks often saw limited combat in their intended roles.</p>


      <h4 class="green">Light Tank</h4>
      <p> A light tank is a tank variant initially designed for rapid movements in and out of combat, to outmaneuver
        heavier tanks. It is smaller in size with thinner armor and a less powerful main gun, tailored for better
        tactical mobility and ease of transport and logistics. They are primarily employed in the screening, armoured
        reconnaissance, skirmishing, artillery observation, and supplementing landing operations in a fire support role
        of expeditionary forces where larger, heavier tanks are unavailable or have difficulties operating safely or
        efficiently. </p>

      <h4 class="red">Tank destroyer</h4>
      <p> A tank destroyer, tank hunter, tank killer, or self-propelled anti-tank gun is a type of armoured fighting
        vehicle, armed with a direct fire artillery gun or missile launcher, designed specifically to engage and destroy
        enemy tanks, often with limited operational capacities.</p>

      <h1> Tank's weakness</h1>

      the machine is powerful, but without man's control it's just peice of steel. it's also the weakness of the tank.

          <p> The M4 Sherman, officially Medium Tank, M4, was the most widely used medium tank by the United States and
        Western Allies in World War II. The M4 Sherman proved to be reliable, relatively cheap to produce, and available
        in great numbers. It was also the basis of several other armored fighting vehicles including self-propelled
        artillery, tank destroyers, and armored recovery vehicles. Tens of thousands were distributed through the
        Lend-Lease program to the British Commonwealth and Soviet Union. The tank was named by the British after the
        American Civil War General William Tecumseh Sherman.</p>
        <h2>Churchill Heavy Tank</h2>
        <img alt="Churchill Heavy Tank"
          src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Tanks_and_Afvs_of_the_British_Army_1939-45_KID1265.jpg"
          <p> Churchill was a British infantry tank used in the Second World War, best known for its heavy armour, large
        longitudinal chassis with all-around tracks with multiple bogies, its ability to climb steep slopes, and its use
        as the basis of many specialist vehicles. It was one of the heaviest Allied tanks of the war.

        The origins of the Churchill's design lay in the expectation that war in Europe might well be fought in
        conditions similar to those of the First World War, and thus emphasised the ability to cross difficult ground.
        The Churchill was hurried into production in order to build up British defences against a possible German
        invasion. The first vehicles had flaws that had to be overcome before the Churchill was accepted for wide use.
        After several Marks (versions) had been built, a better-armoured specification, the Mark VII, entered service
        with the British Army. The improved versions performed well in the later stages of the war.</p>

          <p> The T-34 is a Soviet medium tank introduced in 1940. Its 76.2 mm (3 in) tank gun was more powerful than
        its contemporaries while its 60-degree sloped armour provided good protection against anti-tank weapons. The
        Christie suspension was inherited from the design of American J. Walter Christie's M1928 tank, versions of which
        were sold turret-less to the Red Army and documented as "farm tractors", after being rejected by the U.S. Army.
        The T-34 had a profound effect on the conflict on the Eastern Front in the Second World War, and had a lasting
        impact on tank design. After the Germans encountered the tank in 1941 during Operation Barbarossa, German
        general Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist called it "the finest tank in the world" and Heinz Guderian affirmed the
        T-34's "vast superiority" over German tanks. Alfred Jodl, chief of operations staff of the German armed forces
        noted in his war diary "the surprise at this new and thus unknown wunder-armament being unleashed against the
        German assault divisions," although its armour and armament were surpassed later in the war.</p>

          <p>The S35 medium tank entered service in January 1936 with the 4e Cuirassiers. At the end of 1937 the SA 35
        gun became available and deliveries of the main production series could begin. By mid 1938 a hundred had been
        produced, 270 on 1 September 1939 and 246 delivered. On this date 191 served with the troops, 51 were in depot
        and four had been sent back to the factory for overhaul. After the outbreak of war a fourth order of 200 was
        made, bringing the ordered total to 700. Later it was decided that from the 451st vehicle onward the tanks would
        be of the improved S 40 type. Production in fact totalled 430 by June 1940, including the prototype and the
        preseries. </p>

        <img alt="Sturmtiger"

          <p>Sturmtiger (German: "Assault Tiger") was a World War II German assault gun built on the Tiger I chassis and
        armed with a 380mm rocket-propelled mortar. The official German designation was Sturmmörserwagen 606/4 mit 38 cm
        RW 61. Its primary task was to provide heavy fire support for infantry units fighting in urban areas. The few
        vehicles produced fought in the Warsaw Uprising, the Battle of the Bulge and the Battle of the Reichswald. The
        fighting vehicle is also known by various informal names, among which the Sturmtiger became the most popular.

        The idea for a heavy infantry support vehicle capable of demolishing heavily defended buildings or fortified
        areas with a single shot came out of the experiences of the heavy urban fighting in the Battle of Stalingrad in
        1942. At the time, the Wehrmacht had only the Sturm-Infanteriegeschütz 33B available for destroying buildings, a
        Sturmgeschütz III variant armed with a 15 cm sIG 33 heavy infantry gun. Twelve of them were lost in the fighting
        at Stalingrad. Its successor, the Sturmpanzer IV, also known by Allies as Brummbär, was in production from early
        1943. This was essentially an improved version of the earlier design, mounting the same gun on the Panzer IV
        chassis with greatly improved armour protection.

        While greatly improved compared to the earlier models, by this time infantry anti-tank weapons were improving
        dramatically, and the Wehrmacht still saw a need for a similar, but more heavily armoured and armed vehicle.
        Therefore, a decision was made to create a new vehicle based on the Tiger tank and arm it with a 210 mm
        howitzer. However, this weapon turned out not to be available at the time and was therefore replaced by a 380 mm
        rocket launcher, which was adapted from a Kriegsmarine depth charge launcher.

        <h2> Chi-Ha Tank</h2>
        <img alt="Chi-Ha"

          <p>The Type 97 Chi-Ha (九七式中戦車 チハ, Kyūnana-shiki chū-sensha Chi-ha) was a medium tank used by the Imperial
        Japanese Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Battles of Khalkhin Gol against the Soviet Union, and the
        Second World War. It was the most widely produced Japanese medium tank of World War II.

        The 57 mm main gun, designed for infantry support, was a carry over from the Type 89 I-Go medium tank. The
        suspension was derived from the Type 95 Ha-Go light tank, but used six road wheels instead of four. The 170
        hp Mitsubishi air cooled diesel engine was a capable tank engine in 1938.

        The Type 97's low silhouette and semicircular radio antenna on the turret distinguished the tank from its
        contemporaries. After 1941, the tank was less effective than most Allied tank designs</p>
